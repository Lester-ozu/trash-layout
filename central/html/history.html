                    <h2>Groundwork for AI (1900 - 1950)</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the early 1900s, there was a lot of media created that centered around the idea of artificial humans. 
                        So much so that scientists of all sorts started asking the question: is it possible to create an artificial brain? 
                        Some creators even made some versions of what we now call “robots” (and the word was coined in a Czech play in 1921) 
                        though most of them were relatively simple. These were steam-powered for the most part, and some could make facial 
                        expressions and even walk.

                    <h2>Birth of AI (1950 - 1956)</h2>
                    <p>This range of time was when the interest in AI really came to a head. Alan Turing published his work 
                    “Computer Machinery and Intelligence” which eventually became The Turing Test, which experts used to 
                    measure computer intelligence. The term “artificial intelligence” was coined and came into popular use.

                    <h2>AI Maturation (1957 - 1979)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The time between when the phrase “artificial intelligence” was created, and the 1980s was a period of 
                        both rapid growth and struggle for AI research. The late 1950s through the 1960s was a time of creation. 
                        From programming languages that are still in use to this day to books and films that explored the idea of 
                        robots, AI became a mainstream idea quickly.

                    <p>
                        The 1970s showed similar improvements, such as the first anthropomorphic robot being built in Japan, 
                        to the first example of an autonomous vehicle being built by an engineering grad student. However, 
                        it was also a time of struggle for AI research, as the U.S. government showed little interest in 
                        continuing to fund AI research.

                    <h2>AI Boom (1980 - 1987)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most of the 1980s showed a period of rapid growth and interest in AI, now labeled as the “AI boom.” 
                        This came from both breakthroughs in research, and additional government funding to support the researchers. 
                        Deep Learning techniques and the use of Expert System became more popular, both of which allowed computers to 
                        learn from their mistakes and make independent decisions.

                    <h2>AI Winter (1987 - 1993)</h2>
                    <p>As the AAAI warned, an AI Winter came. The term describes a period of low consumer, public, and private interest 
                        in AI which leads to decreased research funding, which, in turn, leads to few breakthroughs. Both private investors 
                        and the government lost interest in AI and halted their funding due to high cost versus seemingly low return. 
                        This AI Winter came about because of some setbacks in the machine market and expert systems, including the end 
                        of the Fifth Generation project, cutbacks in strategic computing initiatives, and a slowdown in the deployment of 
                        expert systems.

                    <p>Despite the lack of funding during the AI Winter, the early 90s showed some impressive strides forward 
                        in AI research, including the introduction of the first AI system that could beat a reigning world 
                        champion chess player. This era also introduced AI into everyday life via innovations such as the first 
                        Roomba and the first commercially-available speech recognition software on Windows computers.

                    <p>
                        The surge in interest was followed by a surge in funding for research, which allowed even more progress to be made.

                    <p>That brings us to the most recent developments in AI, up to the present day. We’ve seen a surge in common-use 
                        AI tools, such as virtual assistants, search engines, etc. This time period also popularized Deep Learning 
                        and Big Data

                <p>Now that we’re back to the present, there is probably a natural next question on your mind: so what comes next for AI?</p>
                <p>Well, we can never entirely predict the future. However, many leading experts talk about the possible futures of AI, 
                    so we can make educated guesses. We can expect to see further adoption of AI by businesses of all sizes, changes 
                    in the workforce as more automation eliminates and creates jobs in equal measure, more robotics, autonomous vehicles,
                    and so much more.
